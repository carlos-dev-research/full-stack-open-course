# Exercises
These exercises focus on modeling the communication flow between the browser and the server during web requests. They cover both classic web communication patterns and those used in Single Page Applications (SPAs).

In traditional (classic) web applications, the browser sends a request to the server, which responds by sending back an entirely new HTML page. The browser then replaces the current page with the new one.
In contrast, Single Page Applications avoid full-page reloads. Instead, they send asynchronous requests (e.g., using XMLHttpRequest or fetch) to the server to retrieve data. The browser then updates the DOM dynamically using JavaScript, resulting in a smoother, more responsive user experience.
These exercises help you understand and model these interactions using diagrams and structured observations of browserâ€“server communication.

    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes
```
